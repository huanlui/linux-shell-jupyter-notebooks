# Linux shell Jupyter Notebooks
A set of Linux shell exercises explained by using Jupyter Notebooks. They are based on exercises proposed at 12th Edition of Data Science Master by [KSchool](https://kschool.com/) .

The notebooks (extension .ipynb) can be opened directly from Github. Please, it you experiment some problem opening it, try doing it from an incognito window.

If you want to edit and play with the notebooks, I recommend you to follow de installation notes below.
